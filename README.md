# Vodafone-Menu-Code
This is a code for the Vodafone Menu Code or the pop-up that shows up when the Vodafone short-code is entered on the mobile phone.
This project was made with the C++ programming language as part of the beginner programming for Univerties students.
This code should be used as a guide and not the end of it all as the code may contain certain error types and unfinish task intentionally left for student to review code before using.
Code was written by @ed-coded and is hopeful that the program will add to the beginner experience.
